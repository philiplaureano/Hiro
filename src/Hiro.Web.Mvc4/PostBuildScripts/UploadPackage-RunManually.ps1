#==========================================================
# This script must be run manually.
#
# This script prompts you for a NuGet package file (.nupkg) and then uploads it to the gallery. The project's .nupkg file should be in the same directory as the project's .dll/.exe file (typically bin\Debug or bin\Release).
#
# To run this script from inside Visual Studio, simply right-click on the file and choose "Run with PowerShell". If a command prompt just quickly appears and disappears,
#	then run the "UploadPackage-RunManually.bat" file instead, by right-clicking it and choosing "Run".
# 
# You may edit the values of the $sourceToUploadTo, $apiKey, and $pushOptions variables below to adjust the settings used to push the package to the gallery.
#
# If you have modified this script:
#	- if you uninstall the "Create New NuGet Package From Project After Each Build" package, this file will not be removed automatically; you will need to manually delete it.
#	- if you update the "Create New NuGet Package From Project After Each Build" package, this file will not be updated unless you provide the "-FileConflictAction Overwrite" parameter 
#		when installing. Also, if you do this then your custom changes will be lost. It might be easiest to backup the file, uninstall the package, delete the left-over file,
#		reinstall the package, and then re-apply your custom changes.
